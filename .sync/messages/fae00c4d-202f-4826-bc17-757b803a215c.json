      "content": "Sam had a big math homework assignment. His digital assistant Ada offered to help. 'I can show you how to solve these problems,' Ada said. Ada didn't just give Sam the answers - that wouldn't help him learn! Instead, Ada showed examples and gave hints when Sam got stuck. By working together, Sam finished his homework and understood the math much better!",
