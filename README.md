# EpochCore RAS - Recursive Autonomous Systems

üöÄ **Mission**: Building an AI-first sovereign enterprise operating across IaaS, IoT, PaaS, SaaS, and e-commerce with autonomous self-improvement capabilities.

## üß† Core Philosophy

This project implements **recursive autonomous systems** that not only optimize their outputs, but continuously improve their own optimization mechanisms - creating compounding intelligence that scales without human intervention.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Self-Monitoring**: Systems track their own performance and health
- **Self-Optimizing**: Algorithms improve their efficiency and accuracy over time  
- **Self-Expanding**: Successful components automatically replicate across new domains
- **Zero-Budget Growth**: Leverages free/low-cost tools with exponential scaling potential

## üéØ System Architecture

### 1. Meta-Learning & Meta-Optimization
Algorithms that learn how to learn, recursively updating their own learning strategies:
- Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
- Meta-Reinforcement Learning (RL¬≤)
- AutoML-Zero architectures

### 2. Recursive Evolutionary Engines
Systems that evolve both solutions AND the mechanisms that create solutions:
- Self-generating A/B test trees
- Genetic programming with meta-evolution
- Recursive neural architecture search

### 3. Multi-Agent Swarm Intelligence
Autonomous agents that collaborate, compete, and evolve their interaction protocols:
- Hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning
- Self-organizing team formation
- Dynamic resource allocation

## üîÑ Autonomous Feedback Loops

| Layer | Mechanism | Tools | Mutation Logic |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Product** | Usage-based prioritization | PostHog, Heatmaps | Feature decay detection |
| **Marketing** | Performance-based content mutation | GPT + Embeddings + Supabase | CTR-driven content evolution |
| **Pricing** | Dynamic pricing optimization | Stripe + GPT analyzers | CAC > CLV triggers |
| **UI/UX** | Session friction analysis | Smartlook, FullStory | Auto-friction remediation |
| **Support** | AI ticket clustering | ChatGPT + Vector search | FAQ auto-updates |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Core Infrastructure
- **Backend**: Supabase, Railway, Render

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Developers
1. **Read the Copilot Instructions**: Check [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for comprehensive development guidelines
2. **Set up Development Environment**: Follow the quick start commands in the instructions
3. **Implement Core Systems**: Start with Phase 1 foundation systems
4. **Add Recursive Capabilities**: Progress through Phase 2 and 3 implementations

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone and initialize
git clone https://github.com/Jvryan92/epochcore_RAS.git
cd epochcore_RAS

# Set up basic dependencies
npm init -y
npm install @supabase/supabase-js openai stripe mixpanel-browser

# Initialize autonomous systems
npm install langchain @langchain/openai @langchain/community
```

## üìä Self-Improving KPI Tracking

The system monitors and recursively optimizes these key metrics:

- **Revenue**: Daily % change triggers (Stripe/Payhip/Gumroad)
- **CAC vs CLV**: Auto-pause campaigns when CAC > CLV
- **Engagement**: Rewrite content if CTR < 5%
- **Automation %**: Manual actions trigger workflow creation
- **Launch Speed**: Scope reduction if > 4 weeks
- **Retention**: Feature decay detection and remediation

## üß¨ Autonomous Escalation Modes

The system operates in hierarchical decision-making modes:

| Mode | Function | Autonomy Level |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Executor** | Execute workflows & SOPs | High |
| **Strategist** | Track KPIs ‚Üí suggest experiments | Higher |
| **Architect** | Redesign stack/flows | Highest |
| **Commander** | Resource allocation & focus | Meta |
| **Sovereign** | Create new businesses from insights | Recursive |

## üîÑ Self-Cloning & Verticalization

When products reach success thresholds:
1. **Auto-clone** core logic and structure
2. **Adapt** for new verticals/geographies  
3. **Deploy** with rapid validation
4. **Learn** from outcomes to improve cloning strategy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance
