pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Development Setup

For development setup instructions, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Overview

The EPOCH5 Template provides a complete ecosystem for:

- **Advanced Logging & Provenance**: Hash-chained ledger system with tamper-evident records
- **Agent Management**: Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), registry, and real-time monitoring
- **Policy & Security**: Rule enforcement with quorum requirements and multi-signature approvals
- **DAG Management**: Directed Acyclic Graph execution with fault-tolerant mechanisms
- **Cycle Execution**: Budget control, latency tracking, and PBFT consensus
- **Data Integrity**: Capsule storage with Merkle tree proofs and ZIP archiving
- **Meta-Capsules**: Comprehensive system state capture and ledger integration

## Architecture Components

### Core Modules

| Module | Description | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `integration.py` | Main system orchestrator | Workflow management, system status, validation |
| `agent_management.py` | Agent lifecycle management | DID generation, registry, heartbeat monitoring |
| `policy_grants.py` | Security enforcement | Policy creation, grant management, rule evaluation |
| `capsule_metadata.py` | Data integrity system | Merkle trees, ZIP archiving, integrity verification |
| `cycle_execution.py` | Task execution engine | PBFT consensus, SLA tracking, budget control |
| `ceiling_manager.py` | Resource optimization | Dynamic limits, tier management, performance scoring |

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# System management
python integration.py setup-demo       # Initialize demo environment
python integration.py status          # Show system status
python integration.py validate        # Validate system integrity
python integration.py run-workflow    # Execute complete workflow

# Agent operations
python integration.py agents list     # List all agents
python integration.py agents create skill1 skill2  # Create new agent

# Policy management
python integration.py policies list   # List active policies

# Quick operations
python integration.py oneliner quick-agent     # Quick agent creation
python integration.py oneliner system-snapshot  # System state capture
```

### Web Dashboard

Launch the interactive ceiling management dashboard:

```bash
bash ceiling_launcher.sh
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 for real-time monitoring and configuration.
