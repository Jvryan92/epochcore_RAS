## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Recursive Framework Components

#### Core Framework (`recursive_improvement/`)
- **`base.py`**: Base classes for recursive engines and compounding actions
- **`orchestrator.py`**: Central coordinator managing all engines
- **`scheduler.py`**: Handles timing and orchestration with +0.25 intervals
- **`logger.py`**: Advanced logging system for tracking improvements

#### Engine Implementation (`recursive_improvement/engines/`)
Each engine implements:
- Main action execution (weekly/continuous)
- Pre-action execution (+0.25 interval overlap)
- Compounding logic for accelerated throughput
- Recursive hooks for system integration
- Performance metrics and status reporting

#### System Integration
- **Hooks**: Embedded in `integration.py`, `dashboard.py`, and all major modules
- **Triggers**: Automatic triggers on workflow events, status changes, validations
- **Logging**: All actions tracked with comprehensive metrics
- **Scheduling**: Background scheduler managing weekly cycles and health checks

### Compounding Logic Flow

1. **Main Action Initiated**: Engine starts primary weekly/continuous action
2. **Pre-Action Scheduled**: +0.25 interval pre-action scheduled to run during main action
3. **Overlap Execution**: Pre-action executes while main action is still running
4. **Compound Effect**: Pre-action results influence main action outcome
5. **Recursive Analysis**: Results feed back into system for next cycle optimization

## üìà Performance Characteristics

### Timing Expectations
- **Engine Initialization**: ~2-5 seconds for all 10 engines
- **Manual Trigger**: ~2-3 seconds for full system trigger
- **Pre-Action Overlap**: +0.25 second offset for compounding effects
- **Weekly Cycles**: Automated Monday 2:00 AM execution
- **Health Checks**: Daily automated validation
- **Metrics Collection**: Hourly automated collection

### Scalability Features
- **Parallel Execution**: All engines run independently
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent pre-actions and main actions
- **Resource Management**: Automated resource allocation and cleanup
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating if individual engines fail
- **Auto-Recovery**: Failed engines automatically restarted during health checks

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional configuration via .env file
RECURSIVE_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
RECURSIVE_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL=weekly
RECURSIVE_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=daily
RECURSIVE_METRICS_INTERVAL=hourly
```

### Engine Customization
Each engine can be configured via the initialization config parameter:
```python
engine = RecursiveFeedbackLoopEngine({
    "audit_interval": "weekly",
    "pre_scan_offset": 0.25,
    "mutation_threshold": 0.8
})
```

## üß™ Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Access
```python
from integration import initialize_recursive_improvement_system

# Get orchestrator instance
orchestrator = initialize_recursive_improvement_system()

# Get system status
status = orchestrator.get_system_status()

# Trigger improvements
result = orchestrator.trigger_recursive_improvement("custom_trigger")

# Get engine-specific status
engine_status = orchestrator.engines["feedback_loop_engine"].get_status()
```

### Custom Integration
```python
# Register custom hooks
orchestrator.hook_system.register_hook("custom_event", my_callback)

# Trigger hooks
orchestrator.hook_system.trigger_hook("custom_event", data={})

# Add custom engine
from recursive_improvement.base import RecursiveEngine

class CustomEngine(RecursiveEngine):
    def initialize(self):
        return True
    
    def execute_main_action(self):
        return {"status": "success"}

orchestrator.register_engine(CustomEngine())
```

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Engine Failures
```bash
# Check engine status
python integration.py recursive-status

# Restart specific engine via dashboard trigger
# Or reinitialize entire system
python integration.py init-recursive
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Monitor system resources
python integration.py status

# Check logs for bottlenecks
tail -f logs/recursive_improvements.log

# Clean up old logs
python -c "from recursive_improvement.logger import RecursiveLogger; RecursiveLogger().cleanup_old_logs(7)"
```

#### Dashboard Not Loading Recursive Data
```bash
# Verify recursive system is initialized
python integration.py init-recursive

# Check dashboard logs
python dashboard.py 8000

# Test API endpoints directly
curl http://localhost:8000/api/recursive
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Bounded Execution**: All engines have execution limits and timeouts
- **Validation Checks**: All improvements validated before implementation
- **Rollback Capability**: Failed improvements can be reverted
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents runaway recursive loops
- **Resource Monitoring**: Automatic resource usage monitoring and limits

### Access Control
- **API Authentication**: Dashboard API endpoints can be secured
- **Engine Permissions**: Fine-grained control over engine capabilities
- **Audit Logging**: All recursive improvements logged for compliance
- **Safe Mode**: Emergency stop capability for all engines
