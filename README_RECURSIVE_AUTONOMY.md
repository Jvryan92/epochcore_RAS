## Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Initialize System:**
   ```bash
   python recursive_autonomy_setup.py
   ```

3. **Run Demonstrations:**
   ```bash
   python integration.py setup-demo
   python integration.py demonstrate
   ```

## Architecture

The system is built on a recursive autonomy framework that enables:
- Self-improvement through recursive cycles
- Cross-system integration and propagation
- Autonomous adaptation to changing requirements
- Ethical decision-making with governance oversight

## Cross-Repository Deployment

The system includes hooks for deploying innovations across multiple repositories:

```bash
python recursive_autonomy_setup.py --target-repos "repo1,repo2,repo3"
```

## Monitoring and Validation

Continuous monitoring and validation ensure system integrity:
- Automated testing on all changes
- Performance monitoring and alerting  
- Recursive improvement tracking
- Cross-repo synchronization verification
