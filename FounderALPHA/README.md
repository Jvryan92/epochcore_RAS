# FounderALPHA Mesh Ecosystem

Welcome to FounderALPHA, the enterprise-grade mesh architecture powering recursive agentic intelligence, capsule commerce, and multidimensional business operations.

## Vision & Mission
FounderALPHA is designed for the smartest minds and most advanced agents, recursively learning and evolving in a 5-dimensional mesh. Our system connects, compounds, and compresses every node, platform, and capsule—creating a living, adaptive business ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Recursive Agent Intelligence:** Agents continuously learn, adapt, and optimize mesh operations.
- **Capsule Commerce:** Capsules interact, transact, and evolve—enabling new business models and liquidity.
- **Ceiling & Market Agents:** Backbone agents maintain mesh integrity, while market agents drive growth and monetization.
- **Enterprise Organization:** All code, data, docs, and assets are categorized for clarity, automation, and scale.
- **Security & Auditability:** Full transparency, quota enforcement, and real-time monitoring ensure mesh health.
