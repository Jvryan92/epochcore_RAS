# === Recursive Autonomous Innovation System ===
# This file is part of the EpochCore ecosystem, embedding advanced principles for:
# - Autonomous Issue Analysis & Recursion
# - Self-Generating Test Suites
# - Recursive Dependency Mapping
# - Autonomous Documentation Enhancement
# - Recursive Feedback Integration
# - Self-Tuning Prioritization
# - Automated Reference Implementations
# - Autonomous Playbook Generation
# - Continuous Engine Health Monitoring
# 
# Each module is designed to trigger, analyze, and recursively improve itself and its dependencies,
# ensuring continuous improvement and regression prevention.
# 
# Example architecture:
# - Engines inherit from RecursiveEngine, implementing initialize() and execute_main_action().
# - Feedback, prioritization, documentation, reference implementations, and playbooks are auto-generated and updated.
# - All actions are logged for provenance, and all improvements are cascaded recursively.
