Understanding the Reference Angle

In the unit circle, an angle of 160° lies in the second quadrant. Its reference angle is 20° = 180° − 160°.

Because cosine is negative and sine is positive in quadrant II:

cos 160° = −cos 20°

sin 160° = sin 20°

Finding cos 20° and sin 20°

You can use a scientific calculator (or table of trig values) to get:

cos 20° ≈ 0.9397

sin 20° ≈ 0.3420

Thus:

cos 160° ≈ −0.9397

sin 160° ≈ 0.3420

Computing the Vector Components

Given |v| = 3:

vₓ = |v|·cos θ = 3 × (−0.9397) ≈ −2.82

vᵧ = |v|·sin θ = 3 × 0.3420   ≈  1.03

So you multiply the magnitude by the cosine or sine of the angle to get the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components respectively.
